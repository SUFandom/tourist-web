        hase I of the NorthWind power project in Bangui Bay consisted of 15 of those wind turbines, each with a maximum production capacity of 1.65 MW of electric power, making a total of 24.75 MW. These 15 on-shore turbines are spaced 326 meters (1,070 ft) apart, each 70 meters (230 ft) high, with 41 meters (135 ft) long blades, with a rotor diameter of 82 meters (269 ft) and a wind swept area of 5,281 square meters (56,840 sq ft).
        Phase II was completed in August 2008, and added five more of the same wind turbines, bringing the total maximum capacity to 33 MW.
